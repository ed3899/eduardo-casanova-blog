# Eduardo Casanova

Hello, I'm Eduardo Casanova, and I began my coding journey in 2019 as a response to the Covid outbreak. This led me to switch careers from personal training to becoming a self-taught full stack engineer. Throughout this transformative process, I gained profound insights about myself and human nature. Necessity proved to be an incredible motivator.

Interestingly, even as a child, I found joy in disassembling and reassembling things. Although I briefly attended engineering school, personal reasons led me to drop out. Life's ironies brought me back to the field of engineering through a serendipitous black swan event.

If you're like me—a passionate self-taught learner who believes that the right mindset and a touch of nerdy spirit can enable anyone to acquire any skill—let's embark together on a journey to the realm of software engineering.

Together, we'll create impressive and practical projects to showcase our abilities and explore cutting-edge technologies. We'll challenge conventional notions held by academics, hiring managers, and skeptics who insist that a computer science degree and a decade of experience with every IT tool are prerequisites for success in this domain. Instead, we'll demonstrate our ability to deliver top-notch production code of exceptional quality.

All you need is a reasonably powerful computer, reliable internet access, and an insatiable desire to learn.
